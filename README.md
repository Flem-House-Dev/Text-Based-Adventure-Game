## Description
A MERN stack single-page application allowing users to signup and login to save user progress. On the dashboard, a quick description of the game
is provided and a button to start the game. For each prompt of the game, users are given two choices to take action that leads the user down a path
until an end result is met.

## Process
The process included copying over a basic MERN stack activity from the Vanderbilt bootcamp to start. The user model was modified to fit our application including a username, email, and password. Main.jsx and App.jsx was edited to feature four pages: Dashboard, Login, Signup, and the Game page which are all accessed from the header. The Dashboard features a 'start game' button that once pressed starts up the game. Front-end and back-end files were updated to fit our game including the queries, mutations, typeDefs, and resolvers. The seeds for the game was implemeneted and the UI features Bootstrap styling.
